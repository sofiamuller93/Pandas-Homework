    "The analysis of student scores and school budgets has allowed us to come to the following conclusions\n",
    "-  There is no correlation between grade level and higher or lower test scores\n",
    "-  Higher investment per student does not translate into better test scores. In fact, schools with a spending per student below \\$651 tend to generate better test scores than those spending more than \\$651 per student.\n",
    "-  There are two factors that do seem to reflect a big positive effect in test scores and passing rates. Smaller schools with 1000 students or less and charter schools are shown to outperform bigger district schools."
